Article: Five Important Considerations for Wireframing

I thought that the advice laid out by the article were a great reminder of approaching not just UI, but to any design as well.
Personally, there are many times where I have personally started enthusiatically working on a new project without clearly thinking about the hows and whys.
Like the article advised and through classes like EG-1001 and Ideation and Prototyping, I've found the importance of getting to know the audience in order to plan ahead for my solution.
I was able to do just this on a project I did last summer with a few friends of mine where I did interviews with different communities of people for the app we built at a Hackathon.

Additionally, the article discusses making wireframes for prototyping purposes and for getting feedback. Although we learned a little about how to do brainstorm maps last year, I want to learn more about how to create wireframes quicker and more effectively. Omnigraffle is mentioned as a program for creating wireframes so I want to give that a try sometime.
